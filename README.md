**\*\***SCALA**\*\*\***

Scala is a language that provides a unique combination of features that most programmers would appreciate. It combines the performance and large-scale maintainability associated with compiled languages, the tooling and ecosystem of the Java language and virtual machine, and conciseness and ease of use typically associated with scripting languages.

I have been working in the Scala community for the past decade, maintain many of the open source libraries and tools that power the ecosystem, used Scala professionally in a variety of environments, and have seen the language and community evolve over time. Scala has had its hurdles in the past - glacial compilation speeds, confusing libraries and frameworks, and a community more focused on hype than real work. But in the past five years, the Scala ecosystem has managed to move beyond many of these long-standing issues, emerging as a cleaner and more streamlined experience great for Getting Things Done

    Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language. Scala's static types help avoid bugs in complex applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.

Scala is in a complex fight to overthrow Java. Java has remained one of the most popular, versatile programming languages since the Green Team created it in 1995. Scala was introduced in 2003 with the intent of addressing many of the concerns developers have with Java.

Scala has succeeded where many programming languages trying to compete with Java have failed.

The language, built on top of the Java Virtual Machine, provides:

    1.Compatibility with Java

    2.Interoperability

Anything you use Java for, you can use Scala instead. It’s ideal for back-end code, scripts, software development, and web design. Programmers also tout Scala’s seamless integration of object-oriented features and functional languages as the perfect tool for parallel batch processing, data analysis using Spark, AWS Lambda expressions, and ad hoc scripting with REPL.
